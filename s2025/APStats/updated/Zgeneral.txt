General Strategies for AP Statistics

Be Specific:

Always include numerical values and context.
Example: Instead of saying "a large number of students," specify "25 out of 100 students." This clarifies the scale and ensures a precise understanding.

Define and Show Work:

Clearly define variables and show all calculations step-by-step. This not only demonstrates your understanding but can also earn partial credit for correct methods, even if the final answer is wrong.
Example: If X is the number of successes in a binomial distribution, define it before starting your calculation.

Read Carefully:

Understand the question requirements before answering. Highlight key points or terms to focus your response.

Check Your Answers:

After solving, review your solution. Ensure it fits the problem context and check for calculation errors.

Descriptive Statistics

CUSS Method (for describing distributions):
Center: Use the mean or median depending on the data's skewness.
Example: The median is better for skewed data, while the mean is appropriate for symmetrical data.
Unusual Features: Identify outliers or gaps and discuss their impact.
Example: An outlier might significantly affect the mean but have little effect on the median.
Spread: Discuss variability using range, interquartile range (IQR), or standard deviation.

Example: Standard deviation measures how spread out the data is from the mean.

Shape: Describe the distribution's shape:

Symmetrical: Mean ≈ Median.

Skewed Right: Tail on the right; mean > median.

Skewed Left: Tail on the left; mean < median.

Unimodal: One peak in the data


Bimodal: Two peaks in the data.

Example Scenario:

For a histogram of test scores:

Center: Mean = 75.

Spread: Standard deviation = 10.



Shape: Skewed right, indicating more low scores.

SOCS Method (for analyzing data sets and graphs)





Shape: Identify overall pattern and shape of the data distribution.





Example: Symmetrical, skewed left/right, or unimodal/bimodal.



Outliers: Detect any points that fall far outside the general pattern.





Example: In a dataset with test scores, a score of 100 might be an outlier if most scores are between 50 and 70.



Center: Determine the typical value, using mean or median.





Example: Median is better when there are outliers.



Spread: Measure variability using range, IQR, or standard deviation.





Example: An IQR of 20 indicates that the middle 50% of data points are spread across 20 units.

DUFS Method (for describing scatterplots)





Direction: Determine if the relationship is positive, negative, or neither.

Example: A positive direction means that as x increases, y increases.





Unusual Features: Look for outliers or clusters that do not fit the general pattern.

Example: A point far from the rest of the data in a scatterplot of height vs. weight.





Form: Identify the form of the relationship (linear or nonlinear).

Example: A linear form suggests a straight-line relationship, while a curved pattern indicates nonlinearity.





Strength: Assess how tightly the points follow the form.

Example: A strong correlation means points closely follow a line.

Describing a Relationship (STD)





Strength: Strong, moderate, or weak.





Example: r=0.9 suggests a strong linear relationship.



Trend: Identify if the relationship is linear or nonlinear.





Example: A curved scatterplot indicates a nonlinear trend.



Direction: Positive or negative.





Example: A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, so does the other.

Probability Distributions

Binomial Distribution: (BINS)





B: Binary-either success or failure



I: Independent trials



N: Number of trials fixed



S: Success probability stays the same

Properties: Fixed number of trials (n), binary outcomes (success/failure), independent trials, and constant probability of success (p).

Formula:



 Where



is the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials.

Example: The probability of flipping exactly 3 heads in 5 coin tosses.

Geometric Distribution: (BITS)





B: Binary-either success or failure



I: Independent trials



T: Trials until success



S: Success probability stays the same

Properties: Trials continue until the first success, with constant probability p.

Formula: 



Example: Probability of rolling a six on the third dice roll.

Inferential Statistics

Constructing Confidence Intervals (PANIC method):





P: Define the parameter of interest (mean μ\muμ or proportion ppp).



A: State assumptions:





Random Sample



Normality: For means, use CLT if n≥30; for proportions, check np≥10 and n(1−p)≥10.



N: Name the interval (e.g., 1-proportion z-interval).



I: Calculate the interval:





For proportions: 







For means (unknown σ): 







C: Conclude in context (e.g., "We are 95% confident that the true proportion is between...").

Hypothesis Testing (PHANTOMS method):





P: Define the parameter and significance level (α).



H: State hypotheses (H0​ and Ha).



A: Check assumptions (randomness, normality, independence).



N: Identify the test (e.g., 1-proportion z-test).



T: Calculate the test statistic:





For proportions:







O: Find the p-value.



M: Make a decision (p<α: Reject H0​).



S: State the conclusion in context.

Regression Analysis





Slope Interpretation: For each unit increase in x, y changes by the slope value.





Example: If the slope is 2.5, the predicted score increases by 2.5 points for each additional hour studied.



Coefficient of Determination (R2):





Indicates the percentage of variability in y explained by x.



Example: R2= 0.75 means 75% of the variation in test scores is explained by study hours.



Residual Plots:





No pattern suggests a good linear fit.



Curves or patterns suggest a nonlinear relationship or the need for transformation.

Experimental Design

Sampling Methods:





Simple Random Sample (SRS): Equal chance for all samples.



Stratified (Random): Divide into strata, then sample from each.



Cluster: Randomly select clusters and sample all within them.



Systematic: Sample every kth individual after a random start.



Voluntary: Sample is selected in a way that people do not have to respond



Convenience: Sample people who are easy or comfortable to collect information from.

Bias Types:





Voluntary Response Bias: Participants self-select; often not representative.



Undercoverage: Some groups excluded from the sample.



Non-response Bias: Selected individuals do not respond.



Response Bias: Misleading or biased questions lead to incorrect responses.



Wording of Questions: Question is worded so that a certain response is given. 

Key Formulas and Concepts





Standard Deviation (σ or s):
Measures data spread from the mean.



Z-Score: 



Indicates how many standard deviations x is from the mean.





Central Limit Theorem (CLT):
For large n, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal.

Types of Errors in Hypothesis Testing





Type I Error (α): Rejecting H0​ when it’s actually true.



Type II Error (β): Failing to reject H0 when Ha is true.



Power of a Test:
Probability of correctly rejecting H0; increasing sample size improves power.

Types of Graphs
