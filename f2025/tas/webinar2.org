** Notes

*** About
    - Little bit of softwar and a lot of robotics
    - Didn't grow up anywhere near nasa
    - Central Illinois
    - Very Very Rural
    - Lots of cornfeilds
    - Loved computers and loved softwar
    - At time, way less available
    - It was the 80s as a kid
    - Did play computer games
    - Also wrote some software programs
    - Way before modern internet or youtube tutorials
    - Apple 2e personal computer
    - Also loved to tinker, take things apart and put them back together
    - When was little took apart toaster and somehow put it back together and made it work
    - Not just take them apart, but understand how they work
    - Erector set is old toy that he loved
    - Not even an 80s toy, handme down
    - You could build anything it was a full kit with motors gears and kits
    - Also quite fond of rockets and space program


*** What are engineers?
    - Basically get paid to solve problems
    - That their boss asks them to work on
    - You can solve a problem by fixing somethiong that is broken, or by inventing something new, or putting things together in a never before seen combination
    - Great field for highly technical people
    - Also great feild for creative people -- often missed


*** About College
    - Likes to stress to highscool highschool students
    - WHERE you go to college doesnt matter as much as HOW you do and WHAT you learn
    - Those are  the key things
    - He chose electrical engineering (cs wasn't rlly prominent or popular)
    - Pick a field that interests you
    - Dont pick a feild for salary
    - If interested ---> whole career wont feel like work
    - Any work expereince WHILE in college is an amazing thing to have
      - Not for everyone tho
      - If going to make it harder --> not worth it
      - IF you do it or trade back & forth:
      - Valid but work in college doesnt HAVE to be in feild of study
        - Looks great but not required
        - Any type of work is GOOD work
        - Shows hard work & collaboration
        - Dont turn down bc not dream job


*** About Him
    - Lucky to get intership/coop job with NASA Kennedy in College
    - Very similar things today
    - Worked for time for a semester, didnt go at all
    - Then go to school for semster
    - Back & Forth
    - made it very easy to be hired by nasa post grad
    - 4y bachelors in Electical Engineering
    - Highered full Time
    - Even if NASA didn't higher him
    - Engineers still HIGHYL sought after
    - Buisnesses NEED engineers
    - Everyone needs problem solvers


*** Post Grad
    - 1st non intern job was to investigate failures of electronic systems
    - Figuring out exactly WHAT caused those failures
    - Basically crime scene investigators
    - Microscopes & Testing Equipment
    - Boss: Named Gary
      - Taught him work life balance
      - Made sure he didnt work himself to death
      - A lot of people do
      - Follow your passion even if passion turns away from job
      - Told him if oyu dont whitsle way there & back, you might wanna work somewhere else
      - you SHOULD love the work you do, if not -> you are in the wrong place
    - He took his advice and moved into software development group
    - A lot more interested in software despite hardware degree
    - Compute COntrol System inside NASA Firing Rooms
    - Firing Rooms
      - Large rooms full of engineers and people interacting with them
      - Used to control launch countdown and to monitor the rocket
      - room you always see on tv of nasa launc
      - Worked in this for many years, really really cool job
    - Wasnt forever job at NASA

*** New Group: Tech Development Group
    - Testing theories & inventing new technologies in a lab
    - Working on technologies used on moon or mars some day
    - Coolest job of all in 35y NASA Career
    - Lead a project called The Swarm RObots
      - Used a system of small and inexpensive robots that behave like ants
      - Find and collect rescources on moon/mars
      - Working on proof of concept of hobby level robots on earth
      - Goal is *inexpensive* 
      - Tested it on earth testing prototype, small mobility platform
      - Used to test software


*** Video 
    - Futuristic robotic technologies we plan on using
    - NASA Swarm robots robotsunder construction
    - Studied behavior patterns of ants after they find out piles of food and how they moved aroudn
    - omg ubuntu terminal
    - windows video player tho :(
    - Test software on simulation
    - Simulation of multiple robots searching for rescource
    - Tested in parking lot at work
    - Omg the heat map of the robots is GTK themed :D
    - White spot represents rescource
    - Dark spots are movements
    - Robots came across big pile -> summoned other robots when he came back home
    - Lets all go to the loot!
    - This is how ants work, they use a chemical pheramone trail
    - Replicate ant behavior using wireless technologies
    - 20x normal speed pretty slow :/
    - They just test with hobby level robots, pretty awesome, goal is inexpensive, focus is software, not hardware


*** Another video, approved for public
    - not intersting tho :/


*** Next Project: 
    - Wrote software for novel robot that can excavate
    - Small and lightweight
    - Tough and robust
    - Excavate hard volcanic soil
    - Can do it in low gravity conditions
    - basically 4 rows of cylinders
    - 2 rows of wheels
    - 2 rows of rotary diggers
    - Earth based proof of concept focused on making a working robot similar to moon
    - Woah they use apirl tags just like FTC
    - Been funded to send a version to the moon
    - Thats pretty awesome
    - Smaller version, just as capable, but can fit in any commerical lunar lander
    - In the next few years will go to the moon



*** Why a digging robot?
    - Lot of uses on the moon
    - Can clear area for landers
    - Can dig ditches or trenches, for burying equipment
      - Ex: Equippment, Wires, Or powersource
    - Can protect equipmewnt from vehicles on surface
    - Can extract subsurface Water for drinking or for watering plants
    - Most people think moon is dry
      - It is until several feat below surface
      - Certain of a layer of ice a few feet below the first layer of moon



*** Computer ANimation
    - Land on lander, smaller commerical
    - Deploy on surface
    - Differnet deployment techniques based off of what lander
    - Drives path around lander and chooses ecavation lander
    - Not manually driven, full auto
    - Detect rocks and obstacles
    - Change path to correct dynamically
    - Estimate safe extraction area
    - Main focus is to excavate area in front of lander
    - Drives forward while drums spin, basically takes bite
    - Gets hot due to no air to dissapate heat
    - You have to actively pull heat away from electronics and dump it into empty space
    - Robot also has to recharge
    - Operating in dusty environment:
      - Avoid having to plug in robot becuase it could get dirty
      - Why no solar panels?, Dust covers them
      - Always recharge
    - Contactless charging, pretty awesome
    - Charge transfers through antennas



*** How robot works
    - Teeth on wheeels dig
    - Offset each tooth to minimize forces on robot
    - Can load collected material into hopper arm
    - Wheels can go over rocks
    - Arms and drums
    - Robot can change center of gravity by moving arms to gain wheel contact pressure -> climb steep slope



*** Another Project: Moon Tycoon
    - High Degree precision moon emulation software
    - Simulates for people and tools
    - Still in heavy development
    - Used by nasa mission planners and others to plan detailed and complex lunar missions and equipment, robot, and astronaut interactions
    - Hired intern last week to work on it
    1) Choose Spot
    2) Land Scape Is simulated
    3) Detail is highly accurate
    4) Textures, Lighting SImulations
    5) Place Items & Interact
    6) Place & Drive, and operate robots
       - Arms mechanisms and cameras
    - Lots of tools to work with in the engine



*** NASA Speaker's Burea
    - Group of volunteers that speak about NASA at many schools and events
    - Thats how he is speaking here today
     
*** How has engineering changed throughout the time you have been doing your job?
    - Process of engineering has remianed pretty constant
    - Requirements -> Design -> Reviews
    - Repeat then implemnt
    - End with testing, especially during implementation
    - Tools we use have changed
    - When he started, had computers, but not many of the things we have today
    - We didnt have email access, had just been invented, rising in unbiversties, expaned to companies later on
    - Tools we use have grown exponentially
    - Moon Tycoon is made using Unity
    - Tools so good -> Silly to not use it

*** you’ve researched biologically inspired 'swarm' robotics that mimic ants. When coding these robots for a lunar environment, what is the biggest challenge in translating biological behavior into a software algorithm that can handle the terrain of the Moon?
    - Process involved not the moon but the earth
    - Did not need to solve the problem for the moon, that wasnt the goal
    - Very early research project
    - Once it goes to the next level, demonstrated on lander and put on moon
    - People who work on those would need to take it to the next level
    - Need to simulate and add software layer that wasnt used before


*** Do you have any advice for shy students?
    - When was young, very shy, sister outgoing
    - Hung back
    - Parents said clutching their leg and hiding behind them, while sister is out there
    - evolved since then
    - Has 2 college students, one is shy, one is outgoing
    - Shy tends to open up when he is with HIS people
    - Really into computers, videogames, and software
    - When he is in room with like minded people, he opens up and engages
    - Immerse youre self with like minded people, will naturally get you to open up, and you can expand from there and with expereince become more outgoing in unnatural environments 
    - 


*** Did you ever have moments where you felt as if software/engineering wasn't for you? If so, how did you persist?
    - Imposter syndrome is natural
    - Dont feel bad about it
    - If you gotta do extra stuff then just do it, dont feel bad about it
    - Can be very worthwhile
    - Dont think less
    - Everybody thinks that



*** 	What does a day to day work week look like?
    - Unique job working with robots
    - Not all of coworkers get this oppurtunity
    - Not always amazing and always thsi fun
    - Lot of overhead involved in engineering
    - Start day by going through emails
    - If you run a lot of projects -> lot of emails
    - Not in charge, you wont get as much
    - Time where he was in charge, felt like he couldnt get work done donebc so many emails
    - Less manager -> More work
    - Feel good not behind tho
    - Depends on project tho


*** 	What coding languages or skills should we learn to get to a position like yours?
    - Actual answer is dependent
    - Real answer: use languages YOU are comfortable with and ones that appear to be growing/popular
    - Resume, future employers will see that, see experience
    - Even if not exact language, employers will train
    - Hard to answer because NASA languages are way different from language for SWARM Robots
    - Everything is Differnet
    - Swam project was a few 100k vs billions for mars rover
    - Mars rover needs so many ways to handle problems w/o human interaction
    - Needs big and robust, and redudant software stack
    - Use rlly rlly old software
    - Research project is more modern and currently popular
    - Lab robots use python, just cause its easy and quick, not real time but oyu dont need that


*** What is a good roadmap to learning robotics?
    - Assuming high schooler
    - Has robotics? -> Join
    - I alr did that tho bro -_-
    - Its true tho 
    - Do same at colleges, just get experience and work with them
    - Low friction way to learn
    - Valuble experience
    - Hobby robotics is also good
    - Even legos
    - I also did that bro -_-
    - Im also usiong sphereo bnro any actual advice
    - Arduiono (I said that not him)
    - Even block code, but words is better
    - He lowkey dragging it tho :/
    - Find programmable product


*** 	What are some common challenges you face?
    - Software bugs
    - Can happen because in a hurry, and wrote bad software
    - Hes right 💔
    - Design BEFORE implementation
    - Another challenge is simulation vs reality
    - Integration problem
    - Things might not always work in reality the way you expect them to
    - BEst solution is fix software, AND fix simulation so its more accurate in the future



*** 	How many EDNs have you used in your time?
    - guessing 0
    - If I stacked them all up its not as big as youre thinking
    - Bought yay high
    - i dont rlly use them lowkey 
    - Not as much as should
    - ur a bad example brocluch but lowkey aint nobody doing allat💔
    - only been on new project for a couple weeks and is halfway through his new notebook
    - Lowkey innefficient, hes maybe doing smth right cus documention or he doing it wrong cus he saying to much
    - Stuff he wont look at again, or wont be able to find
    - Always trying to imporve
    - End of meeting🆓
